\section{Customized Scoring}

\paragraph{}
While for many general purposes FLUKA comes equipped with adequate features, more particular circumstances may call for probing the particle stack directly. This is done through external user routines that are only deployed when explicitly linked at compile time. For instance, to determine the distances of closest approach for muons that produce neutrons in the TPC region, access to these data is necessary. For the most part, all the features of FLUKA can be accessed with customized code through the ``mgdraw.f'' user routine.
